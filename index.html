                <h3>Suppose that you're working in a small town administration, and you're in charge of two town elements:
                </h3> <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Parks</li>
                    <li>Streets</li>
                </ol> <br>
                <p>It's a very small town, so right now there are only 3 parks and 4 streets. All parks and streets have a name and a build year.</p>
                <p>At an end-of-year meeting, your boss wants a final report with the following: </p> <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Tree density of each park in the town</li>
                    <li>Average age of each town's park</li>
                    <li>The nameo f the park that has more than 1000 trees</li>
                    <li>Total and average length of the town's streets</li>
                    <li>Size classification of all streets</li>
                </ol>
